# All about Contributing

## The Standards

We are open to all those looking to contribute to the project in one way or another, but we have some standards and expectations.

Examples of a good Contributor include:

* Being respectful to others and the project team
* Be acceptful and calm of your contribution being critized or turned down
* Use good language and don't contribute acts of 'Trolling'
* Contributions should be helpful and improve the project, not something for your own benefit

The Standards:

* Your contribution should be done for the good of the project as a whole
* The contribution should be done according to how the project's overral style and format
* All code contributions should be done in the project's code style and make use of the built-in API when possible
* If you plan to contribute something large like a whole new biome and new mobs, we highly recommend to discuss it with the team members.
  We love suggestions, but they should be approved by the team before commiting
